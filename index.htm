<h1>ZC4UW<br> DXpedition to UK Sovereign Base Area on Cyprus &mdash; January 2020</h1>
</hgroup>

<section id="info">
<h1>Announcement</h1>
<p>A group from Cambridge University Wireless Society will be QRV from the UK Sovereign Base Area on Cyprus as ZC4UW from 2-7 January with a maximum of 4 stations.</p>
<p>Ops are likely to include G3ZAY M0BLF M0VFC G7VJR M0ZXA G7SOZ M0WUT and M0BBB.</p>
<p>The team will be QRV with 400W on 160-10 in principle - though little propagation is expected above 21MHz. 5MHz operation is unlikely as we are limited to 15W EIRP. Antennas will be verticals and the main modes will be CW and SSB. The group will not be on FT8 or FT4. M0BLF's blog prior to the VP2MUW expedition gives some <a href="https://www.domsmith.co.uk/blog/2018/06/09/the-great-ft8-debate/?utm_source=zc4uw&amp;utm_medium=web&amp;utm_campaign=zc4uw-ft8">background to this decision</a>.</p> 
<p>Logs will be uploaded to Club Log and LOTW so please use Club Log OQRS and do not send any cards direct or via the bureau.</p>
<p>CUWS celebrates its 100th anniversary in 2020 and members have been active from many DX locations over the years.</p>
